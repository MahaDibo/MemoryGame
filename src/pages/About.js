      <h2>About This Game</h2>
      <p>
        We are a team of engineering students passionate about creating
        meaningful and engaging digital experiences. This matching game is more
        than just a fun activity. It represents our journey as problem solvers
        and user-centered designers. Through this project, we applied key
        engineering principles such as logic, memory handling, interface design,
        and human-computer interaction. Our goal was to build a game that not
        only challenges memory but also brings joy to users of all ages - from
        children to seniors. By developing this game, we strengthened our
        understanding of front-end development, user experience (UX), and
        accessibility, essential skills for modern engineers building real-world
        applications. This project reflects our belief that engineering isn’t
        just about machines and math. It’s about making life better through
        thoughtful design.
